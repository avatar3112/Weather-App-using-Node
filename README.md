# Weather-App-using-Node
This is a  weather app which uses real time api data to find the temperature of a particular place using Node js. This weather app is deployed on local host using node.
In this app we have used a npm dependency known as requests, which can be added by typing npm i requests in the terminal.

Requests : Requests is a small library that implements fully and true streaming XHR for browsers that support these methods. It uses a variety of proprietary responseType properties to force a streaming connection, even for binary data.
The API is a mix between the Fetch API, mixed with EventEmitter API for the event handling.
We can check all the dependencies used by going in the package.json file. 

The file can be made live by hoting it on local host 8000.

just type npm index.js in terminal.
